Selenium Automation Testing Project using JavaScript
Project Summary
--------------
This project demonstrates hands-on experience in end-to-end automation testing using Selenium WebDriver with JavaScript and Node.js. The automation suite validates a real-world e-commerce user journey on the SauceDemo application, covering login, product handling, checkout flow, order confirmation, application reset, and secure logout.

The execution is intentionally slowed down to improve test stability, visibility, and debugging clarity.

Key Skills Demonstrated
-----------------------
Selenium WebDriver with JavaScript

Node.js based test execution

End-to-end test automation

Explicit wait and synchronization handling

UI interaction stability techniques

Assertion-driven validation

Reusable helper methods

Automation debugging and error handling

Application Under Test
----------------------
SauceDemo E-commerce Application
Website: https://www.saucedemo.com

Test User: performance_glitch_user
Password: secret_sauce

Test Scenario Coverage

Automated User Journey
----------------------
Launch the web application

Login using a performance glitch user account

Reset the application state using the menu

Sort products by name from Z to A

Select and add the first product to the cart

Verify selected product in cart

Navigate through checkout process

Enter customer details

Validate product name and total price on final checkout page

Complete the purchase

Verify successful order confirmation

Reset application state again

Log out securely

Validation Points
-----------------
Successful navigation after login

Product consistency across inventory, cart, and checkout pages

Total price visibility and accuracy

Order completion success message

Logout confirmation via login screen visibility

Technical Stack
---------------
Programming Language: JavaScript

Automation Tool: Selenium WebDriver

Runtime Environment: Node.js

Browser: Google Chrome

Execution Strategy
-----------------
The test execution is intentionally slowed using a reusable delay function to ensure UI stability, visibility, and reliable synchronization. Explicit waits are used instead of implicit waits to handle dynamic page behavior effectively.
